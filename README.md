# VEHICLE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-in-C-
Create a `Vehicle` base class with brand, model, static count, and constructor. Derive `Car`(seats) and `Motorbike`(engineCapacity), override `displayInfo()`. Use global `companyName`, create objects, store via base pointers, use polymorphism. Add `updateModel()`, file write/read, exceptions for invalid seats/engine capacity.
